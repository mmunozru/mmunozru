### Hi! I'm Marissa Munoz-Ruiz ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a grad student in the M.S. Health Data Science (HDS) program at Saint Louis Univerisity (Class of 2022). Check out the fun and exploratory repositories I created! As a Data Analyst at Centene Corporation, I use Python and R to improve and automate business processes. 

I am interested in learning about predictive models and machine learning techniques related to health outcomes. Feel free to reach out to me at marissa.munozruiz@slu.edu!

### Hi! I'm Marissa Munoz-Ruiz ðŸ‘‹

I recented graduated with a M.S. in Health Data Science (HDS) from Saint Louis Univerisity (December 2022). Check out the fun and exploratory repositories I created during my program and for fun! 

I am currently a Data Scientist for a Software/IT consulting company based in Maryland. In this remote position, I work in an agile sofware development environment to build dashboards for the Innovation Center at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These dashboards show practices and providers their performance within a given CMS program. I primarily use PySpark and Python via Databricks to preprocess data that will go into dashboards. In my prior role as a Data Analyst at Centene Corporation, I used Python and R to improve and automate business processes. 

I am interested in learning about predictive models and machine learning techniques related to health outcomes. Feel free to reach out to me at mmunozru04@gmail.com!

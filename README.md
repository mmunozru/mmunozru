### Hi! I'm Marissa Munoz-Ruiz ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with a M.S. in Health Data Science from Saint Louis University with five years of experience in healthcare analytics. I am skilled in Python, PySpark, R, SQL, and MATLAB and love learning new data science tools. The data science tools I have used are Azure, Databricks, JuptyerHub, Rstudio, Snowflake, Anaconda, Teradata, and MySQL. 

To see an example of my data science skills, check out the Predicting_Gross_Revenue repository. In this repository, I used the Selenium package in Python to webscrape financial data from a CMS website. I then used PySpark and Databricks to merge and clean the data. I used the Python machine learning packages Sklearn, xgboost, and tensorflow to compare various machine learning techniques to predict the gross revenue of hospitals from hospital cost reports.

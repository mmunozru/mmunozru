### Hi! I'm Marissa Munoz-Ruiz ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a grad student in the M.S. Health Data Science (HDS) program at Saint Louis Univerisity (Class of 2022). Check out the repositories related to my coursework; these repositories start with "HDS" followed by the course number. As a Data Analyst at Centene Corporation, I use Python and R to improve and automate business processes. I am currently developing a Shiny Dashboard for the Quality Department to show employee progress in training courses. 

I am interested in learning about predictive models and machine learning techniques related to health outcomes. Feel free to reach out to me at marissa.munozruiz@slu.edu!

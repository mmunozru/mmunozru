### Hi! I'm Marissa Munoz-Ruiz ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with a M.S. in Health Data Science from Saint Louis University. I love learning new programming languages and so far have developed coding skills in Python, PySpark, R, SQL, and MATLAB. 

To see an example of my data science skills, check out the Predicting_Gross_Revenue repository. This repository uses the Selenium package in Python to webscrape financial data from a CMS website. PySpark and Databricks is then used to merge and clean the data. The Python machine learning packages Sklearn, xgboost, and tensorflow were used to compare various machine learning techniques to predict gross revenue of hospitals from hospital cost reports. 

As a professional data scientist, I am interested in using data science and machine learning techniques to improve patient care and health outcomes. I believe everyone deserves quality and efficient care. In my most recent position as a data scientist for an IT consulting company, I worked in an agile sofware development environment to build dashboards for the Innovation Center at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The dashboards were used to support policy decisions about the U.S. healthcare system. The data science stack I used was Azure, PySpark via Databricks, and Looker.
